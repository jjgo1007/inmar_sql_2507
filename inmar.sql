--1. Which date had the least number of redemptions and what was the redemption count?

--3. What was the createDateTime for each redemptionCount in questions 1 and 2?
/*
  --1. 2023-11-06
  --2. 2023-11-05

--4. Is there another method you can use to pull back the most recent redemption count, by redemption date, 
    --for the date range 2023-10-30 to 2023-11-05, for retailer "ABC Store"? In words, describe how you would do this 
    --(no need to write a query, unless youâ€™d like to)
/*
    Yes. Instead of creating a temporal table, a less straight forward way would be creating a view that pulls 
    the max(createDateTime) for each redemptionDate, then joining that back to the original table to get the redemptionCount's.
    This would avoid the need for row_number() and would still give the most recent redemption count per date, but with a longer
    and more confusing query (might be less efficient as well).
