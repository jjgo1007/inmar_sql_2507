The main task is the result of the uncommented query in inmar.sql file.
The other 3 queries for the question are commented and they give the answer for one of them.
The table used is 'reporting.tblRedemptions-ByDay_fix', which is the original table but with 
2 additional records that have a 0 value on the redemptionCount field.

Here are the answers to the additional questions:

1. Which date had the least number of redemptions and what was the redemption count?
    2023-11-02 with 0 redemptions (createDateTime: 2023-11-06)

2. Which date had the most number of redemptions and what was the redemption count?
    2023-11-04 with 5224 redemptions (createDateTime 2023-11-05)

3. What was the createDateTime for each redemptionCount in questions 1 and 2?
    1. 2023-11-06
    2. 2023-11-05

4. Is there another method you can use to pull back the most recent redemption count, by
redemption date, for the date range 2023-10-30 to 2023-11-05, for retailer "ABC Store"?
In words, describe how you would do this (no need to write a query, unless youâ€™d like to)
    Yes. Instead of creating a temporal table using window functions, a less straight forward way would be creating a one that pulls 
    the max(createDateTime) for each redemptionDate, then joining that back to the original table to get the redemptionCount's using
    the dates as the key. This would avoid the need for window functions and would still give the most recent redemption count per date,
    but with a longer and more confusing query (might be less efficient as well).
